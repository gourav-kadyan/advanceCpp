By default the cpp codes are single thread coz only main is thread if you dont have any thread

thread is like a light weight process -> process is dividing into multiple threads

to create thread --> use to include thread --> cpp11 and onwards

Ways to create threads in c++ 11

    function pointers 
    lambda function
    functors
    member function
    static member function

In main --> if you are making multiple thread there is no gurantee which one firstly make
